# rxjs-tetris
Simple game of Tetris written in ES6 using RxJS

This is a sample implementation of well known game of Tetris I created some time ago using RxJS in order to learn 
and understand it better.
I am fully aware, that the implementation is far from perfect, but it's fully playable. I will probably fix some of
it's issues sometime in the future and/or refactor the code. Or not. It's just a pet project, so I don't take it too serious.

## How to run it?
Just open the index.html file in the browser.

## How do I control the blocks?
Arrows + space to rotate.
